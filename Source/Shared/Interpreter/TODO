# TODO

Test Objects Parser

Break/Continue statement doesn't work if not in highest scope
Return statement would also have the above issue

Move definitions elsewhere for stuff in Utils
Language/translations for error messages
Parser lookup table/functions for parsing primary expressions and statements
Evaluation data should be an object

Function Declaration name changes
-# (ident -> member expr/ident so local function object.myFunction() {} is valid syntax)

more Built in libraries (output system)
Returns (list of exprs or smth)
For Statement (cancer)
Classes
Unary (numeric and boolean)

Compile to Luau
Linter (in Luau for now)

rojo sourcemap --watch --output sourcemap.json & rojo serve
